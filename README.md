am currently running my 3rd year thesis in Chiapas on white supremacy post pandemic
(nazism/sionism) and how new online narratives are infusing new ways of colonizing: 
from the innocent wellness industries to the israel real estate mafia 
and the new roads of western white touristic extractive economy and its slave system.
