- üëã Hi, we're @gambiologits
- üëÄ we're interested in ''decolonizing'' the shit out from github
- üå± we're currently working mith mycelium and biodata
- üíûÔ∏è we're looking to collaborate with decolonial guilds of knowledge
- üì´ please dont contact us, we will.


In 2015 we had the opportunity to bring brillant minds around the table at SXSW, counting Bruce Sterling as techno-Shaman in chief and Joi Ito guru and ex-director at the MIT medialab as well as George Church (white man with god complex). 

Sadly George Church, was afraid of the meeting and never showed up, wine was definetly poored into Bruce's glass, also Joi Ito called us ''trouble makers''. The intro was set up propper, pop corn reaady, the show could begin.

We talked about science fiction and bourgeois bio-art inspired from cyberculture and counter culture narratives within the fabric of certain biomaterial design for sustainability. Frankly it was heaven on earth and warm weather too, George CLinton with the P-funk orchersta was rehearsing near by, what else do you need?

At the end of the discussion thought, Bruce Sterling told the audience out of the blue '' you're not a community untill you face your dark side'' and literraly took over di mood...even the Medialab tweeted about it, realy by now it should be an NFT (under name: cryptopunk.prophecies.sxsw.biatch) you're welcome:

Indeed MIT Medialab was accepting annonymous funds to sponsor obscur science project that we are still trying to decypher here on github actualy:)

We found out that most kids accepting grants from MIT medialab have never been trained in any critical or political theories, virgin in thoughts with potentialy life changing biotechnologies i hands. What could go wrong when young kids trained with an entreuprenarial mindset agregating datas to present to investors. It's like Jeff Besoz being the Washington POst, what can possibly go wrong.

Once we visited a lab in NYC partialy sponsored by the Medialab. A kid born in a luxurious downtown NYC surrounding (daddy is a doctor). He was showing off his check that he received from the Medialab so he could buy more lab equipment, a camera was pointed at him so he kind of told many stories at once. But as soon as you confront these priviledged bourgeois individals with who sponsors them you start to create the oposit of what science should be: transparency, they often use transparency and open source narrative but they realy are about the total opposit.

By avoiding to look at the dark side of sponsors we fuel anti-science behaviours and complotism to a level never reach before, how science is being sponsored matter. Yes its unconfortable to face politics sometimes, but it could avoid the whole dramatic event that the MIT medialab had to face. Controversies with Bill Gates and Jeffrey Epstein sponsorship, behind secret science projects.

### open source / transparency / inclusivity / diversity 

those are the keywords to sell products nowadays, As curators we don't care how much money you are laundering, or if you are a pimp, but we care H O W you treat the people that you work with. This is not an advice, it's a trigger warning, please stop legitimizing  wealthy sociopath with eugenistic vision.
