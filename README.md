- üëã Hi, we're @gambiologits
- üëÄ we're interested in ''decolonizing'' the shit out from github
- üå± we're currently working mith mycelium and biodata
- üíûÔ∏è we're looking to collaborate with decolonial guilds of knowledge
- üì´ please dont contact us, we will.


In 2015 we had the opportunity to bring brillant minds around the table at SXSW, counting Bruce Sterling as techno-Shaman in chief and Joi Ito guru and ex-director at the MIT medialab as well as George Church (white man with god complex). 

Sadly George Church, was afraid of the meeting and never showed up, wine was definetly poored into Bruce's glass, also Joi Ito called us ''trouble makers''. The intro was set up propper, pop corn reaady, the show could begin.

We talked about science fiction and bourgeois bio-art inspired from cyberculture and counter culture narratives within the fabric of certain biomaterial design for sustainability. Frankly it was heaven on earth and warm weather too, George CLinton with the P-funk orchersta was rehearsing near by, what else do you need?

At the end of the discussion thought, Bruce Sterling told the audience out of the blue '' you're not a community untill you face your dark side'' and literraly took over di mood...even the Medialab tweeted about it, realy by now it should be an NFT (under name: cryptopunk.prophecies.sxsw.biatch) you're welcome:

Indeed MIT Medialab was accepting annonymous funds to sponsor obscur science project that we are still trying to decypher here on github actualy:)

We found out that most kids accepting grants from MIT medialab have never been trained in any critical or political mindset, just entreuprenarial pitches and human calculators agregators of private often pattented datas presented inna form of design fiction mini stories, verry inspiring often shinny but much hollow

Once we visited a lab in NYC partly sponsored by the Medialab, a kid in downtown NYC squatting in his luxurious sky crapper parent flat... showing off his check that he received from the Medialab so he could buy more lab equipment for a project in olympic games in Tokyo...changing colours of plants by modifying them genetically...what's next? a Virgin Galatic travel outer space?

By avoiding to look at the dark side you fuel anti-science behaviours, how science is being sponsored matter. Yes its unconfortable to face politics sometimes. This is why sarcastic poets like Bruce Sterling exists, satire live and direct. We have seen it all in the cyber space.

### open source / transparency / inclusivity / diversity 

those are the keywords to sell products nowadays, As curators we don't care how much money you are laundering, or if you are a pimp, but we care H O W you treat the people working with you. This is not an advice, it's a trigger warning, please stop legitimizing  wealthy sociopath with eugenistic vision, or we'll keep sending cyber-anthropolgists to your live events.
