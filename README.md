- 👋 Hi, we're meta-transdisciplinarian story taylor
- 👀 we're interested in science and music
- 🌱 we're currently working mith mycelium and biodata
- 💞️ we're looking to collaborate with decolonial guilds of knowledge
- 📫 Pardon my french but dont contact us, we will...thanks


We have decolonized our portfolio of heavy pictures and videos to a more lightweight form of propaganda:

extract of 10 years of story tayloring worldwide > [DIY low def portoflio](https://gambiolo.github.io/media-portfolio/) 

7 years of curating/organising/talking/facilitating > [conferences/lectures worldwide](https://gambiolo.github.io/curation-portfolio/)

we keep certain things not on github because you know Bill Gates just bought the platform, but you can still scroll the repositories if you feel like digging. thanks
