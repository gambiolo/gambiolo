- 👋 Hi, we're @gambiologits
- 👀 we're interested in decolonizing science
- 🌱 we're currently working mith mycelium
- 💞️ we're looking to collaborate with decolonial guilds of knowledge
- 📫 we'll reach to you, please dont contact us we shy.


In 2015 we had the opportunity to bring brillant minds around the table, counting Techno-Shaman > Bruce Sterling as special guest. We met in Berlin in 2014 at CTM and We briefly discussed about organising a discussion on biohacking with Joi Ito and George Church at SXSW.

Sadly George Church was afraid of the meeting and never showed up, Joi Ito took his place, wine was poored into glasses, Joi Ito called us ''trouble makers''. The show could begin. The whole discussion went fairly well talking about science fiction and bourgeois bio-art. Bref all went well.

At the end of the discussion Bruce Sterling told the audience out of the blue '' you're not a community untill you face your dark side'' and the best thing is that the MIT tweeted it, realy it should be an NFT (name: cryptopunk prophecies) you're welcome:

Indeed MIT Medialab was accepting annonymous funds to sponsor obscur science project that we are still trying to decypher (that's why we here on github actualy). We heard alot about eugenic and social darwinistic ideologies at the MIT medialab and Japan/California/Swiss and so we started investigate. We found out that most kids accepting grants from MIT medialab have never been trained in critical theory, they only been trained to calculate and agregate datas to present it out loud on tiktok or instagram so they can get more fundings from companies...and there's nothing wrong with that this is how prostitution works since millenias

We visited a lab in NYC partly sponsored by the Medialab, some kids in downtown NYC in his luxurious parent flat showing off his check that he received from Joi Ito to be able to buy more lab equipment...when we confronted them with the reality of the fundings they start getting nervous and do stupid and naive things like virgin kids would do. yayyyy science

This is exactly how you fuel Trump/Johnson/Bolsonaro voters, especially at such top level institutional fund programs. By avoiding to look at the dark side of the sponsors you create more confusion and anti-science behaviours than the world needs. Yes its unconfortable to face politics sometimes. This is why poets like Bruce Sterling exists.

Be carefull when you use ''open source / transparent / inclusive / diversity'' narrative. Because if you are attached to an institution you legitimize the fuck out of them... As curators we are aware that without fundings it's hard to create knowledge and clearly we dont care how much money you are laundering, or if you are a pimp, but we care HOW you laundering it and how you treat the people working with/for you. Especially if you come from a priviledge background.

This is not an advice, it's a trigger warning, please stop legitimizing evil behaviours, dont be like google or Gates or an army of cyber-anthropologits will come knocking at your door asking redondant philosophical questions.
