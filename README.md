# Meta-transdisciplinarian is:

- 💻 not a journalist /
- 📷 neither  artist /
- 🐺 nor a designer / 
- 🍎 nor gardener /
- 🔧 nor artisan / 
- 🎓 nor sholar / 
- ✂  nor coder / 
- 🎛 nor DJ / 

-  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) but surely we interested in many technics
 

# 2021 we decolonize our digital uses 
from how much it actualy cost to post a photo online to crypto NFTs, 
we are currently being asked to reconsider the verry infrastructure of our web usages 
so we had to decolonize our old portfolio by using github or gitlab soon:

## - 2008-2021  > [mass media production](https://gambiolo.github.io/media-portfolio/) 

## - 2013-2021  > [worldwide curating](https://gambiolo.github.io/curation-portfolio/)

## - 2013-2021  > [anthropology in the Biotechnoscène](https://www.flickr.com/photos/79382209@N05/sets/?fbclid=IwAR02Tu1dptDLE2LMHFWjO0JiL_E5B7dy1zAO5iBM3kDxnuLrrV_I6qXmB50)

## - linktree //> [8 hyperlinks](https://linktr.ee/dailylaurel)

##  One video collab we did with Viceland just to present how we leave

[![also we do videos in extreme environement here's an extract ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86488172/130331627-daa029dc-796e-4b87-ba34-52c3db63d900.png)](https://www.facebook.com/dailylaurel/videos/1822920581289077/ "Viceland collab")



## lastly we had the opportunity to do collabs with festivals, labels and various sponsors in the field of undeground music. One could not have be done wihtout the other:


- Resident Advisor / 
- Gilles Peterson /
- J.A.W familly /
- Boiler Room /
- Rough Trade /
- Brainfeeder /
- Ninja Tunes /
- Carharttwip /
- Dimensions /
- Lord Quas /
- Dekmantel /
- Rappcats /
