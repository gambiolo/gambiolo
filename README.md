- üëã Hi, we're @gambiologits
- üëÄ we're interested in ''decolonizing'' from github
- üå± we're currently working mith mycelium
- üíûÔ∏è we're looking to collaborate with decolonial guilds of knowledge
- üì´ we'll reach to you, please dont contact us we shy.


In 2015 we had the opportunity to bring brillant minds around the table, counting Bruce Sterling as techno-Shaman and super star sci-fi author. We met one year before at CTM and We briefly discussed about organising a confrontation on biohacking at SXSW with Joi Ito and George Church. 

Sadly George Church (god complex) was afraid of the meeting and never showed up. Joi Ito took his place, wine was poored into glasses, Joi Ito called us ''trouble makers''. The intro was setting up the show could begin. The picture went fairly well talking about science fiction and bourgeois bio-art inspired from cyberculture and counter culture. Bref we all be delighted and such, frankly it was heaven on earth and warm weather in Austin, George CLinton was rehearsing near by, what else do you need?

At the end of the discussion thought, Bruce Sterling told the audience out of the blue '' you're not a community untill you face your dark side'' and literraly took over di mood...even the Medialab tweeted about it, realy by now it should be an NFT (under name: cryptopunk.prophecies.sxsw.biatch) you're welcome:

Indeed MIT Medialab was accepting annonymous funds to sponsor obscur science project that we are still trying to decypher here on github actualy:)

We found out that most kids accepting grants from MIT medialab have never been trained in any critical or political mindset, just entreuprenarial and fairly soialy darwinistic. Icredible power but they only been trained to calculate and agregate datas and to present it out loud on tiktok or instagram...and there's nothing wrong with that, prostitution exist since the very beginning of time. It's just a matter of how it's done.

Once we visited a lab in NYC partly sponsored by the Medialab, a kid in downtown NYC squatting in his luxurious sky crapper parent flat... showing off his check that he received from the Medialab so he could buy more lab equipment. When we confronted them with the reality of the fundings they start getting nervous and do stupid and naive things like virgin kids would do. yayyyy science.

By avoiding to look at the dark side you fuel anti-science behaviours, how science is being sponsored matter. Yes its unconfortable to face politics sometimes. This is why poets like Bruce Sterling exists, satire live and direct, it always beautiful to share his sarcastic points of views, he been there since the begining of it all.

WHen you receive money form institution, because frankly we cannot advance without them, be carefull when you use ''open source / transparent / inclusive / diversity'' narratives because usualy you are just a legitimizing tool for them. As curators we are aware that without corporate fundings it's hard to create knowledge and clearly we dont care how much money you are laundering, or if you are a pimp, but we care HOW you treat the people working with you. Especially if you come from a priviledge background.

This is not an advice, it's a trigger warning, please stop legitimizing evil behaviours, dont be like google or Gates or be ready for a rethorical army of cyber-anthropologits who would come knocking at your door asking redondant philosophical questions.
